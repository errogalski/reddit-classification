# reddit-classification
An ensemble model that classifies sports Internet posts are discussing using NLP

## Executive Summary
In our modern world of the internet and huge amounts of information it has become increasingly important to ensure that you are doing everything you can to beat the noise and get through to users. This means both identifying which users to target and how to best capture their interest and nothing in the world can tell you how to do that better than the users themselves. 

While this may seem to be a daunting task, utilizing the right tools can make it extremely manageable. In this report we present an opportunity to utilize a tool called natural language processing to compare posts of different users to identify what sport they are talking about and what sports they are passionate about. 

Our model uses posts from reddit.com to get samples of how users interested in different sports are speaking about that topic. We analyzed the terminology, common phrases, as well as post sentiments. With that information, we were able to apply our model to other Reddit posts - ones the model had never seen before - and get predictions on which sports users were discussing. This report specifically focuses on examining the differences in language used to discuss five major sports: baseball, basketball, football, hockey, and soccer. 

This methodology has proven to be extremely effective at identifying which of these major sports is being discussed in a given post. We recommend this model be used by a marketing team on other social media sites such as Facebook or Twitter, which are not separated into forums specific to their topics, to find fans they may not already be reaching and make sure they engage with those users.

We can also further analyze discussion to find out which players or aspects of the sport are being talked about more positively or negatively to inform marketing decisions of what to promote to continue to increase fan excitement or capture new fans. For example, does our model tell us there is a certain player that is garnering a lot of excitement at the moment? Perhaps a marketing team could look into promoting that player's jersey.


## Problem Statement:
The goal of this project is to examine how the usage of language differs between fans of different sports teams.

## Analysis:
In our analysis, we ingested the titles of reddit posts from r/nfl and r/soccer in a logistic regression model to predict with natural language processing which sport's subreddit a post came from. This initial model was able to predict the sport being discussed very accurately, with a recall score of 0.94. We then expanded the scope to include r/baseball, r/nba, and r/hockey. We again found that our model was very successful, scoring a 0.88. 

We also utilized sentiment intensity analysis to take a look at the sentiment behind the language being used for each sport. This model, however gave much less definitive results, finding the overwhelming majority of posts to be written with neutral language. This is likely due to us utilizing primarily post titles for our dataset since text posts are rare in the sports subreddits. Most of these titles read as news headlines rather than discussion with strong positive or negative sentiment.

## Conclusion:
From our analysis we find that natural language processing can be very successful at identifying which topic is being discussed even as accurately as determining between specific sports. Our model did, however, do better at identifying some sports than others. Soccer was the most successfully identified. This likely has much to do with many of the fans being international and thus having more significant differences in language usage compared to American sports. When soccer was misclassified, it was most mistaken for hockey related discussion. This makes sense because they share more common vernacular (goals, assists, etc) than the other three sports. Our model struggled to identify baseball discussion the most this is likely due to a couple of factors. First, baseball is a very statistics heavy sport where many headlines and post titles are simply statlines/numbers which may be difficult for our model to identify. Second, one of the largest stories in baseball at the time this data was pulled was the suspension of a player for off-field misconduct thus titles discussing that news story would not be using language specific to the sport.

In future work we would like to expand our model to be used on comments as well as submissions. This would increase our sample size for much better sentiment analysis as well as improve our accuracy for identifying general discussion. Both of these would be valuable tools for our primary stakeholders in this study. Being able to scrape discussions and identify fan sentiment regarding certain players or teams are key to helping PR teams identify who fans are excited to see more of. Reddit is unique in that all of these users are posting on dedicated forums for their respective sports however other social media sites like facebook or twitter may have a number of users talking about these sports without interacting with accounts associated with those sports. Being able to recognize those conversations is a valuable tool in the current marketing environment.
